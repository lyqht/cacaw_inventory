# CacawInventory Memory Bank

## Project Context
**Product**: CacawInventory - AI-Powered Collectible Inventory Manager  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Foundation (Revised Plan)  
**Start Date**: [Current Date]  
**Technology Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, IndexedDB, Google Gemini API

## Project Plan Revision
### Major Change: Core Application First
- **Previous Focus**: Landing page development first
- **New Focus**: Core application functionality first
- **Rationale**: Faster user validation, iterative development, immediate value delivery
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks to beta launch vs. marketing-first approach

## Previous Tasks Completed
### Documentation Phase
- [x] Created PRD.md with comprehensive product requirements
- [x] Developed initial Project_Plan.md focused on landing page
- [x] Established Memory.md for task tracking
- [x] Set up Changelog.md for semantic versioning
- [x] Documented Backend.md for future development phases
- [x] Created Schemas.md with data models and interfaces
- [x] Developed API_Documentation.md for future API endpoints
- [x] Outlined Enhancements.md for post-MVP features
- [x] Created Marketing_Plan.md for launch strategy
- [x] **NEW**: Created Project_Plan_Revised.md with core-app-first approach

## Current Tasks (Phase 1: Core Foundation - Weeks 1-3)
### Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture
- [ ] Development environment configuration
- [ ] Core project structure with TypeScript
- [ ] Basic routing and navigation
- [ ] Pixel design system implementation
- [ ] Local storage service foundation
- [ ] Base component library (Button, Card, Input, Modal)
- [ ] IndexedDB wrapper service
- [ ] Error boundary and loading states

### Week 2: Image Capture & Processing
- [ ] Camera integration for item photography
- [ ] Image processing pipeline
- [ ] Basic image storage and retrieval
- [ ] Image optimization and compression
- [ ] Thumbnail generation system
- [ ] Drag-and-drop file upload support

### Week 3: AI Detection Integration
- [ ] Google Gemini API integration
- [ ] Basic item detection from images
- [ ] Detection result processing
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Manual correction interface for AI results
- [ ] Detection history/log system

### Current Focus Areas
1. **Architecture**: Establishing solid foundation with TypeScript and IndexedDB
2. **Image Pipeline**: Camera capture, processing, and storage
3. **AI Integration**: Gemini API integration with error handling
4. **User Experience**: Pixel aesthetic with functional design

## Next Tasks (Phase 2: Core Functionality - Weeks 4-6)
### Week 4: Item Management
- Item creation and editing interface
- Metadata management system
- Item detail views
- Basic search and filtering

### Week 5: Folder Organization
- Folder creation and management
- Hierarchical organization system
- Folder-based item filtering
- Bulk operations

### Week 6: Data Persistence & Export
- Robust local storage system
- JSON export/import functionality
- Data backup and recovery
- Performance optimization

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Strategic Pivot**: Core application development before landing page
2. **Technology Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + IndexedDB
3. **AI Provider**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for item detection
4. **Storage Strategy**: Local-first with IndexedDB, cloud sync in Phase 5+
5. **Timeline**: 12-week development cycle to beta launch
6. **Solo Development**: 40 hours/week with structured time allocation

## Important Notes & Reminders
- **MVP Focus**: Core functionality over polish in early phases
- **User Validation**: Early testing and feedback collection priority
- **Performance**: Target <3s load time, <100ms UI response
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout development
- **Mobile First**: Design and develop with mobile-first approach
- **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and fallback strategies

## Blockers & Dependencies
### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### Critical Dependencies
- Google Gemini API access and quota
- IndexedDB browser support and quota limits
- Camera API permissions and functionality
- Image processing performance on mobile devices

### Risk Mitigation
- API usage monitoring and cost controls
- Storage quota monitoring and cleanup strategies
- Fallback detection methods (OCR + manual entry)
- Performance testing with large datasets

## Success Metrics Tracking
### Phase 1 Targets (Weeks 1-3)
- 0 critical bugs in core functionality
- AI detection accuracy >70%
- Image processing <200ms per image
- Local storage operations <100ms
- Mobile camera integration working

### Quality Gates
- Daily: Basic functionality testing
- Weekly: Integration testing and performance checks
- Phase End: Comprehensive testing and user acceptance
- Pre-Launch: Full regression and accessibility audit

## Resource Allocation (Solo Developer)
### Weekly Schedule (40 hours)
- **Monday-Wednesday**: Core development (24 hours)
- **Thursday**: Testing and bug fixes (8 hours)
- **Friday**: Documentation, planning, research (8 hours)

### Skill Development Priorities
1. **AI Integration**: Gemini API best practices and prompt engineering
2. **IndexedDB**: Advanced local storage patterns and performance
3. **Image Processing**: Canvas API and compression techniques
4. **Mobile UX**: Touch interactions and responsive design

## Team Communication Notes
- **Solo Project**: Self-directed with weekly progress reviews
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed progress logs for future reference
- **Testing**: Implement automated testing from early phases
- **User Feedback**: Plan for early beta testing and iteration cycles
