# CacawInventory - Core Application Development Plan
# Revised Focus: MVP Application First

## Executive Summary

This revised project plan prioritizes building the core CacawInventory application functionality over the landing page. As a solo project, this approach allows for faster user validation, iterative development, and immediate value delivery to early adopters.

## Strategic Rationale

### Why Core App First?
1. **Faster User Validation**: Get real user feedback on core functionality
2. **Iterative Development**: Build and test features incrementally
3. **Technical Learning**: Understand AI integration challenges early
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Focus limited solo development time on value-creating features
5. **Market Entry**: Launch with working product vs. marketing-first approach

### Deferred Elements
- Comprehensive landing page (basic version only)
- Extensive marketing materials
- Complex onboarding flows
- Advanced analytics and tracking
