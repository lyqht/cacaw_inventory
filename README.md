## ❓ FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: Why do I see errors about 'fingerprint.js' being blocked or missing in development?**
A: Some ad blockers or privacy extensions block files with 'fingerprint' in the name, which can break icon imports from lucide-react. This project includes a postinstall script that automatically removes the Fingerprint icon from lucide-react after install. If you still see issues, try disabling your ad blocker for localhost or re-run `npm install` to ensure the script runs.

**Q: How do I reset my local data?**
A: Clear your browser's IndexedDB storage for this site.

**Q: Why isn't AI detection working?**
A: Make sure your API key is set up in the Settings page and you have a stable internet connection.
